# Prompt Engineering Demo: Python to Java with GitHub Copilot

This demo showcases the "Good → Better → Best" approach to prompt engineering using **GitHub Copilot**.  
**Scenario:** Convert a simple Python function to Java.

You'll also see how using **Custom Instructions** in Copilot can dramatically improve its responses, making them more helpful, educational, and tailored to your needs.

## Files in This Demo

- [`good.md`](good.md): Minimal, basic prompt example
- [`better.md`](better.md): Improved, more specific prompt example
- [`best.md`](best.md): Highly detailed and context-aware prompt example, with recommended best practices

## Why Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering means crafting your prompt (the question or instruction you give to Copilot) to get the most accurate, relevant, and useful results.

- **Good prompts** get the job done, but may lack clarity or detail.
- **Better prompts** add context and constraints, leading to improved results.
- **Best prompts** specify exactly what you want, for whom, and how, producing consistent, high-quality output.

## Custom Instructions in Copilot

Custom Instructions let you tell Copilot about your background, preferences, and desired response style.

**Example Custom Instructions:**
- _What would you like Copilot to know about you?_  
  "I am a Python developer learning Java. Please explain code transitions and always include comments."
- _How would you like Copilot to respond?_  
  "Use simple language, add comments to all code, and give example usage."

With Custom Instructions enabled, even basic prompts generate richer, more tailored responses.

## How to Use This Demo

1. **Review the three prompt files:**  
   - See how each step improves the output.
2. **Try each prompt with Copilot:**  
   - Compare results with and without Custom Instructions.
3. **Discuss with your team or workshop:**  
   - What works best for your context?
   - How will you write prompts and set Custom Instructions in your workflow?
