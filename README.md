The repo is intended to showcase best practices for Prompt Engineering.

This repo includes a skeleton setup for creating custom instructions and reusable prompt files

# Prompt Engineering Demo: Python to Java with GitHub Copilot

This demo showcases the "Good → Better → Best" approach to prompt engineering using **GitHub Copilot**.  
**Scenario:** Convert a simple Python function to Java.

You'll also see how using **Custom Instructions** in Copilot can dramatically improve its responses, making them more helpful, educational, and tailored to your needs.

## Files in This Demo

- [`good.md`](good.md): Minimal, basic prompt example
- [`better.md`](better.md): Improved, more specific prompt example
- [`best.md`](best.md): Highly detailed and context-aware prompt example, with recommended best practices

In addition to the basic prompt engineering examples, this repository includes new resources to help you get the most from GitHub Copilot and structured prompts:

- [`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](.github/copilot-instructions.md) (example):  
  Template for repository-level Copilot custom instructions.
- [`custom-instructions-example.md`](custom-instructions-example.md):  
  Illustration of how to write effective Copilot instructions, with commentary on best practices (context, intent, clarity, specificity).
- [`tests.md`](tests.md):  
  Examples showing how to use the `/test` command with increasing levels of detail and effectiveness.
- [`reusable-prompts-examples.md`](reusable-prompts-examples.md):  
  A collection of ready-to-use prompts for Copilot (chat, comments, or documentation), plus guidance on how to apply them for your team.

## Why Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering means crafting your prompt (the question or instruction you give to Copilot) to get the most accurate, relevant, and useful results.

- **Good prompts** get the job done, but may lack clarity or detail.
- **Better prompts** add context and constraints, leading to improved results.
- **Best prompts** specify exactly what you want, for whom, and how, producing consistent, high-quality output.

## Custom Instructions in Copilot

Custom Instructions let you tell Copilot about your background, preferences, and desired response style.

**Example Custom Instructions:**
- _What would you like Copilot to know about you?_  
  "I am a Python developer learning Java. Please explain code transitions and always include comments."
- _How would you like Copilot to respond?_  
  "Use simple language, add comments to all code, and give example usage."

With Custom Instructions enabled, even basic prompts generate richer, more tailored responses.

## How to Use This Demo

1. **Review the three prompt files:**  
   - See how each step improves the output.
2. **Try each prompt with Copilot:**  
   - Compare results with and without Custom Instructions.
3. **Explore the new resources:**  
   - Use the new example files for your own prompt engineering experiments.
   - Adapt the reusable prompts and instructions for your team's workflow.
4. **Discuss with your team or workshop:**  
   - What works best for your context?
   - How will you write prompts and set Custom Instructions in your workflow?
